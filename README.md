## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide users with a fun, rewarding quiz which challenges their knowledge of popular movies.
With this intention in mind, the website has been designed with three different types of question; A "Picture" question type, a "Trivia" style question, and a "Fill in the blank" question. The wireframes for these are in the UX / UI section below.

This variety in question presentation and in the popularity of the movies included aims to keep the user entertained and stimulated.

Clean and simple styling combined with large text and images are used to draw the users attention to the main content and minimise distraction.

A combination of styling in CSS and functionality using JavaScript and Bootstrap make the website attractive and engaging, furthering our goals of providing a positive and interactive user experience.

### Bugs
Example Bug:

We had an issue with the modal used to accept and display the user's submitted name; the modal would reset as the page re-loaded after the submission, creating an endless loop:

![image](assets/media/bug-report-endlessloop.gif)

This was finally resolved in mob programming, with the insertion of this line in the function as per Eva's suggestion:

This fully resolved the issue.

Example Bug 2:

We had a second issue with the above Modal implementation - the user could insert their name and the expected HTML changes would take place ; yet the Modal would not close:

![image](assets/media/bug-report-modal-not-hiding.png)

This was triaged as being due to missing CSS styling that was needed as part of the javascript, that had been lost between merges. Returning this CSS resolved the issue, and allowed the 'Hide Modal' function to work correctly again:

Example Bug 3:

We had an issue with the Modal feature failing to close if the user tries to use the optional Close button:

![image](assets/media/bug-report-broken_close.gif)

This has been fixed by adding a new Event Listener, to resolve this issue:

## Known Bugs

#### Trivia Page Functionality

We had difficulties getting one of our Javascript functions to apply to the trivia page. 
The function worked fine on our main page but, due to time constraints, we could not find the error which causes it to not respond as intended on the trivia page.

To be rectified at start of next sprint.
