## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide users with a fun, rewarding quiz which challenges their knowledge of popular movies.
With this intention in mind, the website has been designed with three different types of question; A "Picture" question type, a "Trivia" style question, and a "Fill in the blank" question:

[*placeholder for image of each question type, side by side *]

This variety in question presentation and in the popularity of the movies included aims to keep the user entertained and stimulated.

Clean and simple styling combined with large text and images are used to draw the users attention to the main content and minimise distraction.

A combination of styling in CSS and functionality using JavaScript and Bootstrap make the website attractive and engaging, furthering our goals of providing a positive and interactive user experience.
