## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide users with a fun, rewarding quiz which challenges their knowledge of popular movies.
With this intention in mind, the website has been designed with three different types of question; A "Picture" question type, a "Trivia" style question, and a "Fill in the blank" question:

[*placeholder for image of each question type, side by side*]

This variety in question presentation and in the popularity of the movies included aims to keep the user entertained and stimulated.

Clean and simple styling combined with large text and images are used to draw the users attention to the main content and minimise distraction.

A combination of styling in CSS and functionality using JavaScript and Bootstrap make the website attractive and engaging, furthering our goals of providing a positive and interactive user experience.

## Testing

Example Bug:

We had an issue with the modal used to accept and display the user's submitted name; the modal would reset as the page re-loaded after the submission, creating an endless loop:

This was finally resolved in mob programming, with the insertion of this line in the function as per Eva's suggestion:

This fully resolved the issue.

Example Bug 2:

We had a second issue with the above Modal implementation - the user could insert their name and the expected HTML changes would take place ; yet the Modal would not close:

![image](assets/media/bug-report-modal-not-hiding.png)

This was triaged as being due to missing CSS styling that was needed as part of the javascript, that had been lost between merges. Returning this CSS resolved the issue, and allowed the 'Hide Modal' function to work correctly again:
